Am I sweating
Or are these tears on my face?
Should I be hungry?
I can't remember the last time that I ate.
Call someone
I need a friend to talk me down

But one foot wrong and I'm gonna fall
Somebody gets it, somebody gets it
But one foot wrong and I'm gonna fall
Somebody gets it, Somebody gets it
All the lights are on but I'm in the dark
Who's gonna find me? Who's gonna find me?
Just one foot wrong
You'll have to love me when I'm gone.

Does anyone see this?
Lucky me, I guess I'm the chosen one
Color and madness
First in line I put my money down
Some freedom
Is the tiniest cell in town

But one foot wrong and I'm gonna fall
Somebody gets it, somebody gets it
But one foot wrong and I'm gonna fall
Somebody gets it, Somebody gets it
All the lights are on but I'm in the dark
Who's gonna find me? Who's gonna find me?
Just one foot wrong
You'll have to love me when I'm gone.

Some people find the beauty in all of this
I go straight to the dark side near this
If its it bad
Is it always my fault
Did somebody bring me down
Did somebody bring me down
Did somebody bring me down

One foot wrong, I'm gonna fall
I put one foot wrong and I'm gonna fall
But one foot wrong and I'm gonna fall
Somebody gets it, somebody gets it
But one foot wrong and I'm gonna fall
Somebody gets it, Somebody gets it
All the lights are on but I'm in the dark
Who's gonna find me? Who's gonna find me?
Just one foot wrong
You'll have to love me when I'm gone.

Have to love me when I'm gone
When I'm gone
Have to love me when I'm gone
You'll have to love me when I'm gone
